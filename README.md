# zip-password-recovery
A brute force based zip password recovery script in Python using frequent known words.  

Ever forgot the password of an old but important zip file in your computer. You may remember the words that might be present in the password hpwever you don't remember the order of combination, use this script.  
It creates a password list for you on the go, based on the list of words you remember to be present in the password and then tries all the permuted list of passwords on the zip to recover it.

Enjoy!
