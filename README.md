# zip-password-recovery
A brute force based zip password recovery script in Python using frequent known words.  

Ever forgot the password of an old but important zip file in your computer. You may remember the words that might be present in the password hpwever you don't remember the order of combination, use this script.  
It creates a password list for you on the go, based on the list of words you remember to be present in the password and then tries all the permuted list of passwords on the zip to recover it.

Enjoy!

**Disclaimer**
This tool is for educational purposes only and was created only to show how python can be used to iterate over a list of given words with a length to create a list of possible permutations and then use the same over a password protected zip.
